brainfuck variant
designed for bovines

12 instructions
turing complete
works with variations of the word moo

0 : moo

1 : mOo : move current memory position back by one block

2 : moO : move current memory position forward by one block

3 : mOO : execute value in current memory block as if it were an instruction based on the instruction code value, 3 is invalid because 
          it would create a loop

4 : Moo : if current memory block has a 0 in it, read a single ASCII character from stdin and store it in the current memory block.
          else it will print the data in the block as an ASCII character

5 : MOo : decrement current memory block value by one

6 : MoO : increment current memory block value by one

7 : MOO : if current memory block value is 0, goes to the matching "moo" value and continue, else it will continue with next command

8 : OOO : set current memory block value to 0

9 : MMM : the register is a seperate block from the memory that can stock value, if nothing is in it, calling the command will copy
          the value of the current memory block to the register, else it will copy the value of the register to the current memory block

10 : OOM : print current memory block value as an int

11 : oom : read an integer from stdin and store it in the current memory block

all other characters are considered comments

esoteric language : program made to test the limits of programming language design


how helloworld works:
increments 72 times the current memory block to get the 'H', prints it, increments 29 times to get the 'e', prints it, increments 7 times to get
the 'l', prints it twice, then increments 3 to get the 'o' then prints it.

how fibonnacci works:

first block serves to get the previous number
second to get the actual and third to get a counter

the first line creates the first two '1'
in the main loop:
  we print the first memory block
  copy it to third block (third block serves as a counter)
  copy the second block to the first
  
  in the inner loop:
    we decrease the counter
    we increase the second block
    breaks when counter = 0
  
  go back to the beginning


plan:
  - intro talking about programming languages
    - talking about most used languages
    - talking about types of languages
  - continue more precisely by going to esoteric languages
  - go to the real subject
    - introduce the language
    - explain how it works
    - explain the instructions
    - explain quickly hello world
    - explain fibonacci
    - explain how did i make the interpreter

explain the ascii table
