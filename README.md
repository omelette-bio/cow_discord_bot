<h3 align="center">a discord bot to interpret cow programs</h2>

<p align="left">okayy sooo, ive done some quite cool things, first I reused some code from my interpreter at this repo : https://github.com/omelette-bio/cowlang-researches/tree/main/python-interpreter and then I modified it to have a library that can be used in a discord bot, and then I made a discord bot with it, I added the functionnality to read attached files and execute them, and now, the bot has 20 second limit of running time, so infinite loops will be stopped and the current output... outputted</p>
